## Overview

A Solana blockchain application that hardens North Macedonia's **Safe City** traffic
enforcement system against the wave of phishing SMS scams targeting drivers.

## The problem

Citizens receive SMS messages claiming a traffic violation. Scammers exploit this by
sending near-identical fake messages containing **malicious links** that lead to
credential and payment-stealing sites.

A *legitimate* message looks like this:

> SafeChain MK: Детектиран е сообраќаен прекршок за вашето возило на 15.05.2026 во
> 18:42 часот. … Безбедносен код: **SC-8F3A2B91C7D4** … Не отворајте линкови од
> непознати испраќачи.

## The solution — anti-phishing by design

The core insight: **the legitimate flow never contains a link.**

1. The official SMS carries only a **security code** and never a URL.
2. The citizen opens the official portal **manually**, logging into their account via email.
3. They can enter the code to see if the violation is real.
4. If the violation is real it is stored as an NFT with 4 status messages: Payed, Unpayed, Appeal Pending and Voided.
5. The user can view the evidence, submit an appeal and pay the fine.
6. They pay the fine either through an official non-crypto payment route or
   **on the Solana blockchain** — transparently and verifiably.

Because there is never a link to click, any phishing SMS with a link is *self-evidently*
fake. The app teaches this model and reinforces it throughout the UI.

## How the blockchain is used

Paying with crypto is a **real Solana transaction** (devnet):

- A SOL transfer from the citizen's wallet to the SafeChain treasury account.
- A **Memo instruction** that stores an encrypted payment payload on-chain.
- The confirmed transaction signature becomes an **immutable, publicly verifiable receipt** — anyone can check it on Solana Explorer.
- **Violation NFTs**: SafeChain leverages **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** to manage violation records, creating an immutable, tamper-proof history of traffic offenses.

No custom on-chain program is needed: the app uses Solana's native System and Memo programs, which keeps it reliable and trustless. The memo payload is encrypted by the backend with AES-256-GCM before the wallet signs. Each violation record also carries a **SHA-256 fingerprint**, displayed in the app for integrity verification.

## Features

- Single security-code entry that mirrors the SMS flow exactly.
- Transparent violation evidence — traffic-camera capture, ANPR plate recognition, and a location map.
- Real Macedonian fine prices in EUR, converted to MKD, with the 50% early-payment deduction for the first 8 days.
- Non-crypto payment path backed by the backend/database.
- On-chain fine payment via a Solana wallet, with an explorer-verifiable receipt and encrypted memo.
- PDF Appeal generator with an online signature that gets sent directly to the Minestry of internal affairs.
- Violations stored as NFTs.

## Tech stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- `@solana/web3.js` + Solana Wallet Adapter + SPL Memo
- Node HTTP backend
- Self-hosted MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Solana **devnet**

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:backend
```

In another terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

Then open the printed frontend URL (default http://localhost:5173). The Vite dev
server proxies `/api` to the backend at http://127.0.0.1:8787.

Production build: `npm run build`, then `npm run preview`.

## MongoDB setup

The backend reads `.env.local` / `.env` and connects to MongoDB via Mongoose using
`MONGODB_URI` (defaults to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/safecity_mk` for local development).
Collections and validation are defined in [`backend/src/db/models.js`](backend/src/db/models.js) —
no manual schema step is required, Mongoose creates the collections on first write.

1. Run a local MongoDB instance (e.g. `mongod` or `docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo`), or
   point `MONGODB_URI` at a self-hosted/StatefulSet MongoDB deployment.
2. Seed the demo violations:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

If MongoDB is unreachable, the backend intentionally falls back to the bundled demo
records and an ignored local payment store under `backend/.data/` so the app remains
usable during local development. `/api/health` reports whether MongoDB is configured and
reachable.

## Demo security codes

The portal can read from MongoDB through the backend. Four demonstration records are
also bundled and can be seeded to MongoDB. Enter any of these codes — the first one
matches the example SMS:

## Paying a fine (devnet)

To exercise the real on-chain payment:

1. Install a Solana wallet — e.g. [Phantom](https://phantom.app).
2. Switch the wallet to **Devnet** (Settings → Developer Settings).
3. Fund it with free devnet SOL from <https://faucet.solana.com>.
4. Open a violation, connect the wallet, and click **Pay**.
5. Approve the transaction; the app shows the confirmed signature and a link to
   verify it on Solana Explorer.

Fines use a demo devnet rate (1 SOL = 100,000 MKD) so payable amounts stay tiny.
